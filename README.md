 Dark Mode Feature (darkmode.js)
We’ve implemented a dark mode feature for our website using the darkmode.js script. The dark mode preference is saved locally using localStorage, so users can enjoy their preferred theme on subsequent visits. Here’s a guide to how you can use and contribute to this feature:

How to Use the Dark Mode Feature
Users can toggle between Light Mode and Dark Mode using the switch button available on the top right of the website.
The theme preference (dark/light) is saved locally using localStorage so that the preference persists across sessions.
How to Run the Website Locally with Dark Mode Feature
In order to test and develop the website locally with the dark mode feature, you'll need to serve the files using a local web server like http-server. This is especially useful for ensuring that the dark mode settings work properly when saving to localStorage.

Instructions to Set Up Locally:
Install http-server (if not already installed):

bash
Copy code
npm install -g http-server
Run the Local Development Server: In the project root directory, run:

bash
Copy code
http-server .
This will start a local server that allows you to view the site on http://localhost:8080.

Access the Site: Open your browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:8080
Test Dark Mode: Toggle the dark mode and refresh the page to confirm that the theme persists using localStorage.
